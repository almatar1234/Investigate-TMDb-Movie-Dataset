# Investigate-TMDb-Movie-Dataset

## Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

## Why this Project?
After completing the project, you will:

* Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
* Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
* Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
* Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

## Project Requirements
* Jupyter Notebook
* tmdb-movies.csv

## About TMDd Movies Dataset
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
* Certain columns, like ‘cast’
and ‘genres’, contain multiple
values separated by pipe (|)
characters.
* There are some odd characters
in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry
about cleaning them. You can
leave them as is.
* The final two columns ending
with “_adj” show the budget and
revenue of the associated movie
in terms of 2010 dollars,
accounting for inflation over
time.
